# YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a full stack web application built as part of Colt Steele's Udemy course on Web Development. Users may create a page for a campground, browse existing campgrounds, and leave reviews. It incorporates NodeJS, Express, EJS, MongoDB, CRUD operations, 3rd party APIs such as Mapbox, and more.

The project may be viewed at https://yelpcamp-sbadgett.herokuapp.com/.
